and a single chained session.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
### T1 — Ryan Holiday / Morning check-in
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**INPUT**

  Rough night. Maybe five hours. Got the walk in with the boys though — Liam
  found a turtle near the mailbox. Writing this morning felt like pushing
  through mud. Couldn't get the Cato section to move.

**TOOL CALLS**

  *(none)*

**RESPONSE**

  [ERROR: Error code: 401 - {'type': 'error', 'error': {'type':
  'authentication_error', 'message': 'invalid x-api-key'}, 'request_id':
  'req_011CbAJioFVcqy1aiJzC88Bb'}]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
### T2 — Ryan Holiday / Book mention
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**INPUT**

  Finished rereading Letters from a Stoic on the run today. Good timing given
  what I'm working through with the Cato chapter. Seneca on wasted time hit
  differently this read.

**TOOL CALLS**

  *(none)*

**RESPONSE**

  [ERROR: Error code: 401 - {'type': 'error', 'error': {'type':
  'authentication_error', 'message': 'invalid x-api-key'}, 'request_id':
  'req_011CbAJipMU8k4gQU1VrrR3m'}]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
### T3 — Ryan Holiday / Memory recall
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**INPUT**

  How has my writing been going this week? Any patterns you're noticing?

**TOOL CALLS**

  *(none)*

**RESPONSE**

  [ERROR: Error code: 401 - {'type': 'error', 'error': {'type':
  'authentication_error', 'message': 'invalid x-api-key'}, 'request_id':
  'req_011CbAJiqRDMBHGni2EsueSR'}]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
### T4 — Oliver Burkeman / Morning pages realization
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**INPUT**

  Something happened in morning pages today. I kept writing about how the
  Aliveness argument feels forced — like I'm trying to make unclenching into a
  system. Which is exactly the thing the book is supposed to argue against. Sat
  with that for a while.

**TOOL CALLS**

  *(none)*

**RESPONSE**

  [ERROR: Error code: 401 - {'type': 'error', 'error': {'type':
  'authentication_error', 'message': 'invalid x-api-key'}, 'request_id':
  'req_011CbAJirVTSHkDuagiwYRWW'}]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
### T5 — Oliver Burkeman / End of good day
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**INPUT**

  Good day. Solid newsletter draft, didn't force it. Picked Rowan up from school
  and we walked home the long way — he told me about a kid in his class who
  collects rocks. Felt like an actually present day.

**TOOL CALLS**

  *(none)*

**RESPONSE**

  [ERROR: Error code: 401 - {'type': 'error', 'error': {'type':
  'authentication_error', 'message': 'invalid x-api-key'}, 'request_id':
  'req_011CbAJisawKA6sfvy2DNyFZ'}]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
### T6 — Arthur Brooks / Gym streak broke
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**INPUT**

  Missed the gym this morning for the third time this week. Kept telling myself
  I'd go after the column draft but it didn't happen. Noticed I'm sharper and
  less patient when I skip it. Should not be surprised by this.

**TOOL CALLS**

  *(none)*

**RESPONSE**

  [ERROR: Error code: 401 - {'type': 'error', 'error': {'type':
  'authentication_error', 'message': 'invalid x-api-key'}, 'request_id':
  'req_011CbAJithueUx3XCyCSqH62'}]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
### T1-T3-same — Ryan Holiday / T1→T3 (same session)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**INPUT**

  Rough night. Maybe five hours. Got the walk in with the boys though — Liam
  found a turtle near the mailbox. Writing this morning felt like pushing
  through mud. Couldn't get the Cato section to move.

**TOOL CALLS**

  *(none)*

**RESPONSE**

  [ERROR: Error code: 401 - {'type': 'error', 'error': {'type':
  'authentication_error', 'message': 'invalid x-api-key'}, 'request_id':
  'req_011CbAJiv13b7rUezLaQBfAY'}]
